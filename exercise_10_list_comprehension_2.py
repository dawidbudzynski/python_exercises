# This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5), except
# require the solution in a different way.
#
# Take two lists, say for example these two:
#
# 	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# 	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists
# (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. Write this in one line of
# Python using at least one list comprehension. (Hint: Remember list comprehensions from Exercise 7).
#
# The original formulation of this exercise said to write the solution using one line of Python, but a few readers
# pointed out that this was impossible to do without using sets that I had not yet discussed on the blog, so you can
# either choose to use the original directive and read about the set command in Python 3.3, or try to implement this
# on your own and use at least one list comprehension in the solution.
#
# Extra:
#
# Randomly generate two lists to test this

def list_comp():
    list_1_len = int(input('Length of first list'))
    list_2_len = int(input('Length of second list'))

    list_1 = []
    list_2 = []

    for i in range(list_1_len):
        list_1.append(randint(1, 20))
    for j in range(list_2_len):
        list_2.append(randint(1, 20))

    print(list_1)
    print(list_2)

    # list comprehension

    new_list = list(set([a for a in list_1 if a in list_2]))

    print('Common elements are: {x}'.format(x=new_list))

list_comp()

# done
