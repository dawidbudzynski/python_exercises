# Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new
# list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.


def exe_1(my_list):
    return [my_list[0], my_list[-1]]


a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

print(exe_1(a))

#done
