# For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and
# be able to find that information based on their name. Create a dictionary (in your file)
# of names and birthdays. When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name,
# and return the birthday of that person back to them. The interaction should look something like this:
#
# >>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
# Albert Einstein
# Benjamin Franklin
# Ada Lovelace
# >>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
# Benjamin Franklin
# >>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.
